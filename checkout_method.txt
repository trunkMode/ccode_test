1.method https (read only)
This method don't need any github user accound and you can clone the project:

git clone https://githu.com/lzhouALan/ccode_test.git

2. method ssh (read + write)
This method needs to register one github user account and generate ssh key and add ssh public key into github.
2.1 register one github user account
2.2 Generating a new SSH key

    After you've checked for existing SSH keys, you can generate a new SSH key to use for authentication, then add it to the ssh-agent.

    If you don't already have an SSH key, you must generate a new SSH key. If you're unsure whether you already have an SSH key, check for existing keys.

    If you don't want to reenter your passphrase every time you use your SSH key, you can add your key to the SSH agent, which manages your SSH keys and remembers your passphrase.
2.2.1 Generating a new SSH key

    Open Terminal.

    Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.

    # ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

    This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.

    Generating public/private rsa key pair.

    When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

    Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]

    At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases".

    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
    Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

2.3 Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent

    Before adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key.

    Start the ssh-agent in the background.

    # eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    Agent pid 59566

    Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.

    # ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

    Add the SSH key to your GitHub account.
2.4 Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account

To configure your GitHub account to use your new (or existing) SSH key, you'll also need to add it to your GitHub account.

Before adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account, you should have:

    Checked for existing SSH keys
    Generated a new SSH key and added it to the ssh-agent

Note: DSA keys were deprecated in OpenSSH 7.0. If your operating system uses OpenSSH, you'll need to use an alternate type of key when setting up SSH, such as an RSA key. For instance, if your operating system is MacOS Sierra, you can set up SSH using an RSA key.

    Copy the SSH key to your clipboard.

    If your SSH key file has a different name than the example code, modify the filename to match your current setup. When copying your key, don't add any newlines or whitespace.

    $ sudo apt-get install xclip
    # Downloads and installs xclip. If you don't have `apt-get`, you might need to use another installer (like `yum`)

    $ xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    # Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard

    Tip: If xclip isn't working, you can locate the hidden .ssh folder, open the file in your favorite text editor, and copy it to your clipboard.

    Settings icon in the user barIn the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.

    Authentication keysIn the user settings sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys.

    SSH Key buttonClick New SSH key or Add SSH key.
    In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example, if you're using a personal Mac, you might call this key "Personal MacBook Air".
    The key fieldPaste your key into the "Key" field.
    The Add key buttonClick Add SSH key.
    Sudo mode dialogIf prompted, confirm your GitHub password.
